## Introduction
Hey there! Iâ€™ve just started my journey into the world of web development with the MERN stack. Join me as I learn and grow with these amazing technologies:

- **MongoDB**: The NoSQL database where Iâ€™ll store my data in a flexible format.
- **Express.js**: The backend framework that makes building servers in Node.js so easy and powerful.
- **React.js**: The library Iâ€™m using to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: The runtime that allows me to use JavaScript on the server side, bringing everything together!

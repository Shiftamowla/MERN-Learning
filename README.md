# MERN Stack Learning Roadmap

## What is the MERN Stack?

MERN is a powerful collection of technologies used to build full-stack web applications. It consists of:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Express.js**: A fast, minimalist framework for building web servers in Node.js.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic, interactive user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side.

Together, these technologies allow you to develop both the frontend and backend of web applications using JavaScript, making it easier to create full-stack apps.

## Learning Goals
- Understand each technology's role in the MERN stack.
- Start building basic full-stack applications.
- Connect the frontend (React) to the backend (Node & Express) and MongoDB.

## Next Steps
1. Learn **MongoDB** (Database).
2. Dive into **Express.js** (Backend).
3. Get hands-on with **React.js** (Frontend).
4. Practice using **Node.js** (Server-side).

Letâ€™s start learning and building with the MERN stack! ðŸš€
